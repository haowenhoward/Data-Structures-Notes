**Matrix**
A matrix is a 2 dimensional array, can be represented as a list of lists in python 3.<br>
this list of lists follows several rules so it can represent a matrix:
all rows have the same amount of values, all columns have the same amount of values, all items are in the same data type, indexing starts at zero.

Example:
```python:
my_matrix = [[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]] #this is a matrix
```
**List Comprehension**
List Comprehension is the method to concisely create lists.
The syntax of list comprehension is:
1.A Square Bracket containing an expression that describes the list.
2.One or more For clause to explain its members.
3.Then a zero or more if clauses depending on the complexity of the list.

Example:
```python:
#Generate a list of even numbers from 0 to 100
my_list = [x for x in range(101) if x % 2 == 0]
#or
my_other_list = [x for x in range(0,101,2)]
```
